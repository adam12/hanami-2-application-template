# Hanami 2 Application Tempalte

To create an app from this template:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/timriley/hanami-2-application-template.git my_app
cd my_app
./bin/install my_app
```

This template is already a standalone, fully functional Hanami 2 application.
Running `./bin/install` will rename all instances of `AppPrototype` (in all its
case formatting) to the name of your new application.

See [README.app.md](README.app.md) for details of the generated application.
